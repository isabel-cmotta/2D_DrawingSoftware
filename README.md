# 2D_DrawingSoftware

The project consists of developing an environment to create and edit primitive types of geometric figures.

This project was made in Java in BlueJ for the Computer Graphics and Image Processing class of the 4th semester of the Computer Science course at PUC-SP.

##Installation

Download the folder ***2D_Drawing_Software*** and extract all the files. 

To open the project, BlueJ must be instelled, then open the file **package**.

To run, compile all and execute the Class named **App**.

## Usage

This application allows the user to create primitive types of geometric figures such as: 
  - Points
  - Lines
  - Rectagles
  - Triangles
  - Cicles
  - Mandalas (specific kind of mandala figure using circles, triangles and rectangles)

These geometric types can be edited and the project have some other options as:
  - Thickness of the line
  - Change Colours
  - Select a figure
  - Clear the window (only clears the figures on the device window)
  - Redesign 
  - Ctrl + Z (reverse the last action you performed)
  - Clear the Data Stucture (clears all the figures from the data structure so they can't be redesigned)
  - Save
  - Read File
  - Geometric Transformations
    - Translation
    - Rotation
